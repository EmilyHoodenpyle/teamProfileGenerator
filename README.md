## Installation

In order to install this project, you will need to havev already installed Visual Studio Code (or some other code editing software with JS, HTML, Node, and CSS capabilities). From there it is just a matter of cloning the SSH key to your desktop and openning the files in your editing software.

## Credits

Code created from scratch by me, based on inclass assignments for University of Washington's continuing education coding bootcamp.
